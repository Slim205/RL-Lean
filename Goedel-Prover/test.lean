  Given \( x, y, z \) all exceed 1 and a positive number \( w \) such that \( \log_x w = 24 \), \( \log_y w = 40 \), and \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \), we need to find \( \log_z w \).
  1. From \( \log_x w = 24 \), \( \log_y w = 40 \), and \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \), we can express these logarithmic relationships as:
     \[
     \log_x w = 24 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24
     \]
     \[
     \log_y w = 40 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40
     \]
     \[
     \log_{xyz} w = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12
     \]
  2. Using the properties of logarithms, we know:
     \[
     \log (x \cdot y \cdot z) = \log x + \log y + \log z
     \]
     Substituting this into the third equation, we get:
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log x + \log y + \log z} = 12
     \]
  3. Given \( \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24 \) and \( \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40 \), we can solve for \( \log x \) and \( \log y \) in terms of \( \log w \):
     \[
     \log x = \frac{\log w}{24}, \quad \log y = \frac{\log w}{40}
     \]
  4. Substituting these into the equation \( \frac{\log w}{\log x + \log y + \log z} = 12 \):
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\frac{\log w}{24} + \frac{\log w}{40} + \log z} = 12
     \]
  5. Simplifying the denominator:
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\frac{\log w (5 + 12)}{120} + \log z} = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\frac{\log w (17)}{120} + \log z} = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\frac{\log w}{120} + \log z} = 12
     \]
  6. Further simplification yields:
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\frac{\log w + 120 \log z}{120}} = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\frac{\log w + 120 \log z}{120}} = 12 \implies 12 \cdot \frac{120 \log z}{\log w + 120 \log z} = 12 \implies 1440 \log z = 12 \cdot \log w + 1440 \log z
     \]
  7. Solving for \( \log z \):
     \[
     1440 \log z = 12 \cdot \log w + 1440 \log z \implies 1440 \log z - 1440 \log z = 12 \cdot \log w \implies 0 = 12 \cdot \log w \implies \log w = 0
     \]
  8. Since \( \log w = 0 \), we have \( w = 1 \). However, this contradicts the given conditions that \( w \) is a positive number. Therefore, we must have made an error in our assumptions or calculations.
  9. Reconsidering the problem, we realize that the correct approach is to use the given logarithmic values directly and solve for \( \log_z w \).
