Informal-based scaffolded data synthesis 
generate synthetic data in NL  : harder and easier Qwen-32
generate questions at the same time to have diversity.
assess the diversity and the correctness using 4 Qwen judges. 

training : 
SFT with expert iteration
RL for compiler signal correctness
Pass 1 increase and pass 32 decreases.
