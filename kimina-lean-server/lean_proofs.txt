theorem no_integer_solutions_3x_sub_2y2_eq_10 (x y : ℤ) : 3 * x - 2 * y^2 ≠ 10 := by
  /-
  We aim to show that there are no integer solutions to the equation \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\). We start by considering the equation modulo 3. We analyze the possible values of \(3x\) and \(2y^2\) modulo 3 and show that they cannot sum to 10 modulo 3. This leads to a contradiction, proving that no integer solutions exist.
  1. **Modulo 3 Analysis**:
     - \(3x\) modulo 3 is always 0 because \(3x\) is a multiple of 3.
     - \(2y^2\) modulo 3 can be 0, 1, or 2 because \(y^2\) modulo 3 can be 0, 1, or 2.
     - We compute \(3x - 2y^2\) modulo 3 for each combination of \(3x\) and \(2y^2\) modulo 3.
  2. **Conclusion**:
     - Since \(3x - 2y^2\) modulo 3 cannot be 1, and we need \(3x - 2y^2 \equiv 10 \pmod{3}\), we conclude that there are no integer solutions to the equation \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\).

  We aim to show that there are no integer solutions to the equation \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\). We start by assuming the contrary, that there exist integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\). We then consider the equation modulo 3. By examining the possible values of \(3x - 2y^2\) modulo 3, we find that it can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. However, 10 modulo 3 is 1, which leads to a contradiction because \(3x - 2y^2\) cannot be both 0 and 1 modulo 3 simultaneously. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, and there are no integer solutions to the equation \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\).

  /-
  We aim to show that there are no integer solutions to the equation \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\). To prove this, we will use a proof by contradiction. Assume that there exist integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\). We will then analyze the possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to derive a contradiction.
  1. **Case Analysis on \(x \mod 3\)**:
     - We consider the possible values of \(x \mod 3\), which are 0, 1, and 2.
     - For each case, we compute \(3x - 2y^2 \mod 3\) and compare it to 10.
  2. **Case \(x \equiv 0 \mod 3\)**:
     - If \(x \equiv 0 \mod 3\), then \(3x \equiv 0 \mod 3\), so \(3x - 2y^2 \equiv -2y^2 \mod 3\).
     - For this to equal 10, \(-2y^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3\), which is impossible since \(-2y^2 \equiv 2 \mod 3\).
  3. **Case \(x \equiv 1 \mod 3\)**:
     - If \(x \equiv 1 \mod 3\), then \(3x \equiv 3 \mod 3\), so \(3x - 2y^2 \equiv 3 - 2y^2 \mod 3\).
     - For this to equal 10, \(3 - 2y^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3\), which simplifies to \(2(y^2 + 1) \equiv 2 \mod 3\), implying \(y^2 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 3\), which is impossible.
  4. **Case \(x \equiv 2 \mod 3\)**:
     - If \(x \equiv 2 \mod 3\), then \(3x \equiv 6 \mod 3\), so \(3x - 2y^2 \equiv 6 - 2y^2 \mod 3\).
     - For this to equal 10, \(6 - 2y^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3\), which simplifies to \(2(y^2 + 2) \equiv 2 \mod 3\), implying \(y^2 + 2 \equiv 1 \mod 3\), which is impossible.
  Since all cases lead to a contradiction, there are no integer solutions to the equation \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\).

  We aim to show that there are no integer solutions to the equation \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\). We proceed by contradiction. Assume there exist integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\). We will analyze the possible values of \(y\) modulo 4, as the equation involves a term \(2y^2\).
  1. **Case Analysis on \(y \mod 4\)**:
     - If \(y \equiv 0 \mod 4\), then \(y^2 \equiv 0 \mod 16\), and thus \(3x - 2y^2 \equiv 3x \mod 16\). For \(3x \equiv 10 \mod 16\), we would have \(3x = 16k + 10\) for some integer \(k\). However, \(16 \nmid 10\), so \(3x \equiv 10 \mod 16\) is not possible.
     - If \(y \equiv 1 \mod 4\), then \(y^2 \equiv 1 \mod 16\), and thus \(3x - 2y^2 \equiv 3x - 2 \mod 16\). For \(3x - 2 \equiv 10 \mod 16\), we would have \(3x = 16k + 12\) for some integer \(k\). Again, \(16 \nmid 12\), so \(3x \equiv 10 \mod 16\) is not possible.
     - If \(y \equiv 2 \mod 4\), then \(y^2 \equiv 4 \mod 16\), and thus \(3x - 2y^2 \equiv 3x - 8 \mod 16\). For \(3x - 8 \equiv 10 \mod 16\), we would have \(3x = 16k + 18\) for some integer \(k\). Again, \(16 \nmid 18\), so \(3x \equiv 10 \mod 16\) is not possible.
     - If \(y \equiv 3 \mod 4\), then \(y^2 \equiv 9 \mod 16\), and thus \(3x - 2y^2 \equiv 3x - 18 \mod 16\). For \(3x - 18 \equiv 10 \mod 16\), we would have \(3x = 16k + 28\) for some integer \(k\). Again, \(16 \nmid 28\), so \(3x \equiv 10 \mod 16\) is not possible.
  Since none of the cases \(y \equiv 0, 1, 2, 3 \mod 4\) allow \(3x - 2y^2\) to equal 10 modulo 16, we conclude that there are no integer solutions to the equation \(3x - 2y^2 = 10\).
